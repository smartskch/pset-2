{"name":"Pset2","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome Back to Smart Challenge\r\nWe’re a group of anonymous 12th graders from SKCH. And we thought of giving people this opportunity to hone their problem solving and logic skills in a fun way.\r\nA disciplined approach to problem solving is the need of the hour due to the many problems we face in everyday life. Apart from a disciplined approach, creativity is also involved in the solution of many problems in life.\r\nOften, flawed solutions teach us how to correct our procedure of solution and to overcome the frustration that follows failure.\r\nSolving these questions will also improve your self confidence levels.\r\nWe have included problems of different types-each requiring different thinking so as to give you this experience. Hope you enjoy!\r\n\r\n### Rules\r\n+ Solutions can be sent to smartchallengeskch@gmail.com \r\n+ Solutions without justification will not be accepted.\r\n+ This sheet will be removed two weeks after posting.\r\n+ Answers will be posted physically and online at the link given above.\r\n\r\n### Problem Set - 2\r\n\r\nProblem 2.1.Survival\r\n\r\n*You have been arrested by the king’s guards and are among the prisoners.\r\n*In a very generous mood , the king decides to let only one prisoner go by killing all the others.\r\n*The prisoners are arranged in a circle and are numbered 1 to 100 and No.1 is given a knife.\r\n*Starting from 1 , each kills the next number and passes the knife to the next alive person.This goes on until only   one prisoner remains.\r\n*Which number do you want to be?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nProblem 2.2. Lockers\r\n\r\n A school with 100 students has exactly 100 lockers.On the first day of school the students decide on the following plan:One student will enter the school and open all the lockers.A second student will then enter and close all the even numbered lockers.A third student will then enter and reverse every third locker, closing one if it is open or opening it if  it was closed.A fourth student will reverse every fourth locker and a fifth every fifth locker and so on until all the students have entered and reversed the appropriate lockers. How many lockers will finally remain open?Given any number 'n' , can you tell if n is open?\r\n\r\n---\r\n####random\r\n---\r\n### Solutions\r\nSend in your solutions to smartchallengeskch@gmail.com\r\nSolutions will be updated in the github repository.
