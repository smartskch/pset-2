<p>We’re a group of anonymous 12th graders from SKCH. And we thought of giving people this opportunity to hone their problem solving and logic skills in a fun way.
A disciplined approach to problem solving is the need of the hour due to the many problems we face in everyday life. Apart from a disciplined approach, creativity is also involved in the solution of many problems in life.
Often, flawed solutions teach us how to correct our procedure of solution and to overcome the frustration that follows failure.
Solving these questions will also improve your self confidence levels.
We have included problems of different types-each requiring different thinking so as to give you this experience. Hope you enjoy!</p>
